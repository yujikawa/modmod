## Why

Before publishing to npm, the project needs a final polish. This includes removing boilerplate assets from Vite/React, acknowledging the libraries that made this possible, and setting an appropriate initial version.

## What Changes

- **Cleanup**: Remove default Vite and React assets from the `visualizer/` directory.
- **Credits**: Add a "Credits" or "Acknowledgements" section to `README.md`.
- **Versioning**: Set the initial release version to `0.1.0`.
- **Logo Update**: Ensure the logo path in the UI is correct and clean.

## Capabilities
